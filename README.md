# Camp Sites

## Overview
This website was built using bootstrap and was constructed in an attempt to broaden and deepen my understanding of bootstrap components. This site takes advantage of many of bootstrap's features including: toolkits, modals, accordions, nav-tabs, navbars, cards, tables, grid-system, utility classes, forms, and more. You can find a link to the deployed site [here]().

Below are some screenshots to show some of the site's features and design aesthetic. Having used bootstrap, along with minimal media queries, media responsiveness was achieved.
