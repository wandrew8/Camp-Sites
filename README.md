# Camp Sites

## Overview
This website was built using bootstrap and was constructed in an attempt to broaden and deepen my understanding of bootstrap components. This site takes advantage of many of bootstrap's features including: toolkits, modals, accordions, nav-tabs, navbars, cards, tables, grid-system, utility classes, forms, and more. This site also makes a call to the National Park Service API to show available campsites in the area. You can find a link to the deployed site [here](https://secret-atoll-00242.herokuapp.com/).

Here are some screenshots of the working site below:
